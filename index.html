                <span>Everyone keeps asking us like it's some big discovery.  (The story of the diet my brother and I
                    undertook this year.)

            <h1>The Counting Diet</h1>

            <h2>History of No Hunger</h2>
            <p>As a kid I was always raised to eat everything served to me.  Not complaining, my mom was a great cook, and a
                nurse, so she probably knew what I needed to eat even if I claimed to be full.  Especially if it was collard
                greens.  I could never stomach those, still can't.  However looking back now as an adult I realise this habit
                of cleaning off my plate each time isn't a good one.  Especially if you go to a restaurant with generous
                portions or even the worst which I can only visit on cheat days: The Buffet.  I realise now this attidue of
                not being hungry is one that for a long time always got in my way.

            <h2>Futile Attempts to Curb Weight Gain</h2>
            <p>We all try it I suspect.  At least most of the adults I run into do.  "Oh I'll take the diet drink." (Afraid of
                cancer rumors?) "I'll take a water." (My favorite since restaurants like to claim low meal costs by not
                including that $3 drink price.)  Meanwhile I'm stocking my plate full of potatos and fried food.  If you did it
                I probably did.  Even included a day or two of exercise, but never everything alltogether.  There is no partial
                attempt to lose weight, certainly yes any effort is better for you, but when everyone tells you diet and
                exercise, they mean it.
            </p>

            <h2>Encouragement</h2>
            <p>For me having issues with sticking with anything I plan to do; it helps to remind myself daily that I want to do
                it.  Even if it takes me a year of telling myself on a weekly basis eventually that idea will not leave your
                head and you'll find yourself thinking of it each time you do something that opposes it.  This applies to things
                not even related to dieting.  Any vice you want to curb try it, I don't guarantee results though.  In fact I can
                say from personal experience it took one thing more than weekly reminders to get myself motivated:<br><br>Pain
                <br><br>Yep just pain.  Had to suffer for nearly a year with lower back problems from an injury that due to my
                poor posture and belly refused to go away.  When you are young you don't realise how good you have it.  You heal
                so much quicker than you do as you grow older.  Motivation from the idea of living with constant pain from my
                obesity and not wanting to cover up the problem with medication, partly due to that cost, is a great way to get
                started.
            </p>

            <h2>The Idea</h2>
            <p>So at last with some history we arrive at the big secret:</p>
            <h2>Math</h2>
            <p>Such a simple thing.  We learn it sometimes before speech.  2000 calories is the magic number.  You've probably
                heard this before and barely gave it mind but it's true.  In fact these last five years it's become so much
                easier to do this because of the availability of nutritional information at restaurants.  We always had access
                to that information but the restaurants knew it would hurt business if people actually knew how much they
                were putting into their bodies.  In fact I could see it being a great benefit to society and a detriment to the
                food industry if you had a personal tracker keeping count for you throughout the day.  We usually don't.
                Ignorance after all is bliss, and that bliss adds up quick.  It may seem like a hassel at first but once you
                build a personal menu after a while you don't have to count.  You'll know what you can and cannot eat and how
                much before you hit your limit.  Granted always double checking is good but training youself is the most
                important step.<br><br>Other than a number the sky's the limit on what you can eat.  You can literally eat
                anything.  The key is just knowing how much.  If you really need to have a brownie, go for it.  Just when you
                have to decide between a brown two inches square, and a large turkey and cheese sandwich, well, just one of
                those will leave you wanting for me.  And the occasional cheat day will also help but I don't recommend it
                more than once every two weeks and not for your first month.  Everything you can do to get on that track helps.
            </p>

            <h2>Rough but Serious Start</h2>
            <p>To begin the diet we went pretty extreme.  Having just concluded the cheat season: Thanksgiving, Christmas,
                New Year's, we wanted to get situated fast.  I'm 6'5" when not slouching and large framed so given that 2000 is 
                considered average I'm above average.  That puts my limit around 2200.  For the month of January we set a goal
                of 1200 calories.  That may seem extreme but given my tendencies towards food it was necessary.  The idea
                behind the first month was to train ouselves to eat less.  Three meals a day 400 calories apiece.  No cheat days.
                My brother also underwent a challenge for it.  No soda, no pasta, no cheese, no chocolate.  I wasn't able to 
                match it like my brother did, we were served something at work that invalidated it for me.  I believe it was 
                pizza, but I only had 2 slices of cheese pizza.  I used to eat a whole pizza to myself.  I was happy just with 
                keeping to the 400 calorie limit.  We pulled it off though.  I have to say this is definetly the hardest part.
                If you ate probably between 3000-6000 calories a day like I used to you'll find this the hardest part.  You'll
                be hungry everyday, but I can promise you the results are worth the struggle.<br><br>January 4th: 390 lbs<br>
                January 31st: 372 lbs
            </p>

            <h2>The Next Five Months</h2>
            <p>After month one we let up a little.  1500 calorie daily limit.  Typically in the mornings we have a 20oz cup of
                coffee and a toasted bagle or a bowl of cereal or two homemade egg muffins.  The egg muffin is my favorite but we 
                try to be light on those because they have a lot of cholesterol.  It's right at 500 calories though, 2 eggs and
                2 muffins toasted with a half slice of cheese, if we have it, and some mayo.  Lunch has been consistent.  A 
                sliced turkey or chicken sandwich with a coke zero and a v8.  That meal usually is around 400 calories.  After 
                that our supper varies.  There are a variety of frozen meals we've gotten from the grocery store which have
                250-350 calories in them which leaves room for other things.  If we're under budget then that opens up the
                door for say a bucket of popcorn which may be 200 calories each.  Granted not every day did we hit exactly 1500.
                Some days I'm sure it was under and others over.  There was a surge of weight loss at first but then it seemed 
                to even out.  When it started to really decline then exercise came into the picture.<br><br>February 10th: 366 lbs
                <br>March 2nd: 358 lbs<br>April 3rd: 352 lbs<br>May 5th: 344 lbs<br>June 4th: 337 lbs<br>July 21st: 326 lbs<br><br>
                As you can imagine, trying anything strenuos when you are over 60 pounds lighter is much MUCH easier.
            </p>

            <h2>Beginning Exercise</h2>
            <p>Once we realised how much easier it was to walk without getting winded quite suddenly we started walking on a 
                regular basis. At least half a dozen different people warned us, including my brother's doctor, that exercise
                will stop the weight loss and true enough it did.  There's a hurdle to get over.  Muscle actually weighs more 
                than fat in case you didn't know and as you replace fat with it, you negate your weight loss.  The good news is 
                muscles are hungry, so once your activity balances out they will help with the continued weight loss which I am
                still looking forward to.<br><br>August 4th: 321 lbs<br>September 2nd:  319 lbs
